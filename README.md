## üìö Long Description

ClockLive represents a modern approach to the classic digital clock. It moves beyond simple time display to offer a comprehensive, visually engaging time-tracking solution. The application is centered around a large, eye-catching clock that features an impressive slide-in animation on load, immediately capturing attention. Key to its utility is the sidebar, which houses essential configuration options, including the toggle between 12-hour (with AM/PM) and 24-hour formats. The most powerful feature is the **real-time, fully customizable time zone list**, providing crucial global time data at a glance. Furthermore, the optional, resource-intensive color animation provides a "sick" visual experience, making ClockLive as much a piece of digital art as it is a utility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Usage

### Setup and Running

ClockLive is a pure front-end application built with basic web technologies, making setup incredibly simple:

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the repository files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `main.js`, plus others like `save.js`, `console.js`).
2.  **Open:** Drag and drop `index.html` directly into any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  **Start:** The clock starts immediately, and the settings persist across sessions.

### Architectural Overview

The core of ClockLive is efficient client-side JavaScript (`main.js`) handling time calculation. Instead of relying on heavy external libraries, it uses native `Date` and `Intl` objects for accurate local time zone detection and fast manual calculations for static offsets. This design choice ensures extremely low latency and high synchronization accuracy. CSS is leveraged heavily for the smooth animations and dynamic theming, isolating visual complexity from the high-frequency time logic.
