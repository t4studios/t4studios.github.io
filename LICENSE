COPYRIGHT AND LICENSING NOTICE: CLOCKLIVE

Copyright (c) 2025, T4Studio. All Rights Reserved.

This document serves as an **explicit and unequivocal declaration** of the intellectual property rights belonging to **T4Studio** regarding the proprietary web application known as **"ClockLive."** T4Studio asserts its full, legally enforceable ownership over the entirety of this digital work, which encompasses not only the functional elements but also the aesthetic design, structural architecture, and all accompanying documentation.

The website, "ClockLive," is defined to include, without limitation, all source code (specifically HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any associated logic files), every creative asset (images, fonts, and icons), all design elements, the unique user interface and experience (UI/UX) implementation, and any internal documentation or external file describing the project. This exhaustive definition ensures that the copyright protection is applied broadly and comprehensively across the whole deliverable.

**Unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, public display, or performance of the work, or the creation of derivative works based on this project, is absolutely and strictly prohibited.** This prohibition extends to, but is not limited to, mirroring the website on a different domain, incorporating substantial parts of the source code into another project, or utilizing the unique visual design scheme without express permission.

T4Studio has **explicitly and intentionally withheld all consent, expressed or implied**, that would permit any individual, organization, corporate entity, or third party to appropriate this website and claim it as their own. The act of taking the code, making superficial modifications, and subsequently publishing it under a different name, a process commonly known as "forking" or "rebranding," is directly counter to the terms of this notice and constitutes a serious violation of T4Studio's reserved rights.

Any attempt by a third party to **claim ownership of, rebrand, resell, or otherwise represent this proprietary website or any of its constituent components as their original work is a direct breach of this copyright declaration.** Such actions will be pursued with the full extent of applicable intellectual property and copyright law, and T4Studio reserves the right to seek maximum damages and statutory penalties.

The entirety of the rights associated with ClockLive, including the perpetual rights to display, modify, adapt, distribute, and otherwise commercialize the work, are **solely and exclusively reserved by T4Studio.** No element of this file, nor any implied interaction with the website itself, shall be construed as a grant of license for commercial exploitation or personal appropriation.

The restricted nature of this license means that the user is permitted to interact with the software **only in its hosted, intended form** as a consumer of the T4Studio service, and not as an owner or distributor of the underlying code or assets. The code is provided "as is," for viewing pleasure and personal utility within the application's environment, and not for external use.

Furthermore, any and all forms of **decompilation, reverse engineering, or attempts to discover the proprietary algorithms or structural logic of the JavaScript files are explicitly forbidden.** T4Studio maintains that the methods and approaches used to achieve the high-performance clock and animated features are trade secrets and intellectual property, protected from external replication.

This copyright is effective from the year **2025** and covers the software in its current version and all subsequent updates, iterations, and maintenance releases, ensuring a continuous and unbroken chain of ownership protection for T4Studio.

The inclusion of the phrase **"All Rights Reserved"** is a formal legal notice asserting the complete prohibition of any unauthorized intellectual property use not specifically permitted by written contract. It is a powerful legal statement that reinforces T4Studio's intent to retain full control over the distribution and modification of ClockLive.

Should any party desire to utilize this work, its parts, or its concepts in any manner that falls outside the defined scope of personal, non-distributive web interaction, they must first obtain an **explicit, written, and signed permission agreement from T4Studio.** This permission must detail the exact scope, duration, and nature of the licensed use.

The file extension **`.lic`** from the previous file has been removed, and this document is now formally designated as simply **`LICENSE`** within the project directory structure, though its legal force remains absolutely identical in all jurisdictions recognizing international copyright standards.

This license serves as a **permanent and transparent warning** to developers, web masters, and users alike: the code and design of ClockLive are not open source, shareware, or public domain, and any assumption of such status is legally unfounded and invalid.

T4Studio reserves the right to **unilaterally modify the terms of this license** at any time without prior notice, provided that such modifications shall not retroactively grant rights that were previously restricted under this or a preceding version of the notice. The current published version shall always apply.

The structural integrity of the code is protected. Even minor adjustments, such as changing variable names, color schemes, or layout components, if done with the intent to re-launch the work as a separate entity, will be viewed as the creation of a **prohibited derivative work.**

In the event of a dispute, this license agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the intellectual property laws of T4Studio's primary operating jurisdiction, and all parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that jurisdiction.

The aesthetic, high-quality, "sick" visual experience provided by ClockLive is itself considered a protected element of the work, representing a creative expression protected by copyright, distinct from the functional code. Its unique combination of features and style is a guarded aspect of T4Studio's branding.

Any links provided within the application, such as the link to this license, are for informational purposes only and do not convey any rights of usage or ownership over the linked document or the main application.

This document acts as the **sole authority** on the permitted and prohibited uses of ClockLive. No verbal agreements, implied understandings, or third-party interpretations shall supersede the clear, written terms laid out within this comprehensive notice.

T4Studio invests significant creative and technical capital into the development of unique digital experiences, and the terms of this license are necessary to protect that investment and ensure the exclusivity and originality of the ClockLive brand.

The integrity of this license is paramount. Removing, obscuring, or altering the visible copyright notice in the application's footer or within the source code will be considered **evidence of willful infringement** and an aggravating factor in any resultant legal action.

Users are encouraged to enjoy the application as intended—a visually stimulating and accurate time-keeping utility—but must always respect the foundational intellectual property rights that allow T4Studio to continue providing such quality projects.

This licensing declaration extends to all future platforms, devices, and distribution channels upon which ClockLive may be deployed, ensuring its protection is technology-agnostic and universally applicable.

Finally, for the avoidance of all doubt, the copyright and control over this software remain firmly vested in **T4Studio**, and this right is both inalienable and permanent.
